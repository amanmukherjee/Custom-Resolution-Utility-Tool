# Custom-Resolution-Utility-Tool
Custom Resolution Utility (CRU) is a small freeware utility which can tweak your NVIDIA and AMD graphic cards to create higher resolutions for your laptop/desktop displays.
As a portable application, CRU does not require installation and can be run without installation. 
The layout of the program provides a list of currently supported resolutions for your monitor with the option to add new ones. 
The application isn't perfect, but if your monitor can support higher and/or different resolutions from what's displayed in your graphics control panel, CRU will create EDID values in the registry so that you may select the resolutions in your graphics settings.  
Currently supported GPUs are limited to some AMD/ATI and NVIDIA cards, as Intel GPUs are not supported. 
It's worth pointing out that you should have an idea of what your monitor and GPU are capable of. 
If anything goes wrong, the download comes with an app called "reset-all.exe" which can be run to revert any changes you have made with Custom Resolution Utility. 
Or else you can boot your system to Safe Mode to get rid of the changes.

Note: Upon testing this application, I was able to get my display of HP Pavilion Notebook - 15-au624tx that was capped at 60Hz; to 114 Hz without any issues.

Disclaimer: "Use this application at your own risk".
